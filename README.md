## nittany path
### This is an application that is used to model a school course manager for students and faculty. Complete with multiple features like viewing courses, creating assignments, scoring grades, dropping courses, proper authentication, etc. 

This project is built using the React Library. It composes multiple components and renders pages based on the url path dictated by react-router-dom. 

Most of the logic is self explanatory, mainly just a lot of fetch requests to the backend to access the mySQL database information.

A hefty amount of time was also spent on styling this web application to look good, which is done through pure CSS instead of using 3rd party CSS framework.
