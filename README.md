### This is an application that is used to model a school course manager for students, teachers, faculty, and administrators. 

A school course manager is used for many schools in order to keep up communications between students and teachers. It is used to publish certain courses and have a record of grades of certain assignments. I plan on making this application extensive to expected functionality of a course manager. This also has a large focus on database design.
